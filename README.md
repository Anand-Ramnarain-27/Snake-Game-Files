# Snake-Game-Files

I recently developed a clone of the classic Nokia Snake game, and the experience has been both challenging and rewarding. Recreating this iconic game not only allowed me to hone my coding skills but also provided a unique opportunity to push the boundaries of the traditional Snake gameplay. I focused on enhancing the snake's movement dynamics, introducing new challenges, and designing engaging levels to elevate the overall gaming experience. The process encouraged me to think critically about game mechanics and level progression, pushing me to explore innovative ideas within the familiar framework of the classic Snake game. Overall, the project has been a fantastic journey of self-improvement and creativity, inspiring me to continue exploring and refining my game development skills.
